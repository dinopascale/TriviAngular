# TriviAngular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## What is TriviAngular?

TriviAngular is a simple project realized with Angular6, which uses [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php)'s API to build a linear quiz game. It's a personal project with which I delved into Angular's world

## Technologies used

I used: 

* **Angular Material** as UI Component Framework in conjuction with [**Angular Flex Layout**](https://github.com/angular/flex-layout) for the general layout of the webapp. I decided to not focus so hard on the graphic aspect of this project in order to spend more time and energies on the code side.

* **Ngrx** for state management of the application. It was probabily an overkill and it added a lot of boilerplate to the project, but I decided to use Ngrx to better understand into concepts and principles of Redux and challenge myself. A better approach for a simple webapp like this would've be to use Observable Data Services.

* **Optimization** I tried to use as much as possible Angular Modules and Lazy Loading, in order to speed up the performance of TriviAngular.
